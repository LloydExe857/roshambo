# Overview

This program runs a simple version of Rock-Paper-Scissors where the user plays against the computer. Best two out of three, of course.

The program was written as a way for me to learn how to use Kotlin and the IntelliJ IDEA IDE

If you want a little demo, watch this video!

# Future Work

This was my first exposure to Kotlin, as well as the IntelliJ IDEA editor. As a result, there are a few things that will likely need to be fixed or improved in the future, including:
* Adjusting the classes to be more usable by others
* Adding a possible 2-player mode
* Allowing the user to pick how many rounds need to be won to win the game
